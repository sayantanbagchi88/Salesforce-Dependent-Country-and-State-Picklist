"# Salesforce-Dependent-Country-and-State-Picklist" 
his is code which is based on JavaScript and Visualforce. This code snippet we can use in salesforce site. As Salesforce hides the dependency of countrycode and statecode, I created a method which can be used as dependent picklist. Similar kind of method you can find in google.
